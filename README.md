# Mita
 Keep the overview about the series you watch. Mita helps you to remember your series and their episodes status. It is based on laravel and vuejs. However, you should not use it productively yet.

## What is currently working
* Multiple users can manage their own series.
* You can create a new series with season and episode, edit it or delete it

## Soon
* Tidy up and clean (correct error handling and more)
* A nicer page design with hell and dark mode
* The possibility of dividing series into tags
* An api, later a mobile app would be nice
